# Basic_DQN_for_maze
Tensorflow implementation of DQN(Deep Q Learning Neural Networks) for geting out of the maze  
I suggest you look at my project:"Basic_Q_Learning" first.

As you can see from the picture above，the goal of the agent is to walk from room 2 to room 5.  
We can convert the room structure into a map，it is shown below

We can add rewards to the path，it is shown below

We can construct an environmental reward matrix when programming，it is shown below

In the basic q learning algorithm，we train a Q matrix.  
But in the basic DQN(Deep Q Learning Neural Networks) algorithm,we train a Q net.  
You can Optimize this algorithm. If you want to exchange ideas with me，you can add me to WeChat:zggcdbs.
